## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
**Fbaez.com** is my personal website, where you can find out about me through my most important life events. The events are presented along a timeline with animated transitions.

The website was originally a static html+css+js site. I turned it into a simple Nuxt/Vue3 project to be able to divide it into reusable components and make it easier to update its content.
